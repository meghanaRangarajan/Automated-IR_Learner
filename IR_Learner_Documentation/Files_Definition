DOCUMENTATION 

FILES:

remote_UI.py:
	libraries used:
		tkinter : To create the User Interface
		pigpio : to obtain the timing information of the IR signal
			(version number -> 1.64-1)
		urlopen : To search for the remotes with the code

		db_lib : library with the funtions to access, edit, close databases
		IR_Decode : library with funtions to decode the IR signal
		calculate_frequency : library with functions to calculate the frequency of the carrier signal of the IR_Signal

	This Py file is when run launches the user interface which is used to record the codes.

db_lib.py:
	libraries used:
		sqlite3 : To access a database
			(version number -> 3.16.2-5)

	This Py file has various funtions used to access database, edit it, print the items in the database

IR_Decode.py:
	libraries used:
		Decoder : It contains the functions which are used to obtain the timing
			 	information of the IR signal using pigpio and sort it into protocols and decode the signal
	This Py file is used to obtain the code of the IR signal and the Protocol it uses

calculate_frequency.py:
	libraries used:
		freq_calc : It contains the funtions which are used to calculate the frequency
				of the carrier signal of the IR signal
	This Py file is used to obtain the frequency of the carrier signal used in the IR signal

Decoder.py:
	libraries used:
		pigpio : to obtain the timing information of the IR signal
			(version number -> 1.64-1)
		asyncio :  To take care of multithreading
		const : A file that contains the timing information of each protocol
		clean_buffer : It contains funtions to edit the raw buffer to get a more 
			accurate number of frequency cycles of the IR signal
	This PY file contains the functions which are used to obtain the timing
	information of the IR signal using pigpio and sort it into protocols and decode the signal

freq_calc.py:
	libraries used:
		pigpio : to obtain the timing information of the IR signal
			(version number -> 1.64-1)
		asyncio :  To take care of multithreading
	This Py file contains the funtions which are used to calculate the frequency
	of the carrier signal of the IR signal

const.py:
	This Py file contains the constants of each protocol defining the number of frequency cycles in the marks and spaces present in the signal

clean_buffer.py:
	It contains funtions to edit the raw buffer to get a more accurate number of frequency cycles of the IR signal

codes.db:
	It is the local db which gets updated everytime a code is captured and decoded

tv.db:
	it is the local db which is referred to to get the the codes of an existing remote
